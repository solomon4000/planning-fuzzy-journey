## planning

### criteria
The ideas that this is based on are that:
1. The robot arm must be able to pick up any chess piece and move it to another location on a chess board.
2. The robot arm must be able to autonomously recognize red objects, pick them up, and place them in a bin.
3. The robot arm must be able to write letters entered on a keypad.
4. The robot arm must be able to press keys on a piano to play a simple song.
5. The robot arm must be able to at least pick up a pencil stab a hole in a yoga ball for self defence (let's ignore the laws of robotics)
6. ~~The robot arm must be able to launch itself into the air in an emergency~~
7. The robot arm must be able to drive towoards a target as it will be on wheels.

//**Please ignore anything involving a rocket launcher. That idea has been completley scrapped.**
### How to acomplish
To acomplish this we can start with the rocket launcher cause its the coolest. ~~I was going to have a rocket motor strapped to the bottom of it. This lets you 
launch the robot arm into the sky if something goes south.~~ The thing with the yoga ball is just for fun. I want it to detect when someone is sitting on one and race
twords them with a pencil or something and pop it from under them. There is no reason other than I want to add something funny to it.
As for detecting red objects and the chess peice I was going to use color sensors or something of the like. I was going to have the robot arm have 
3 hands/grabbers. I will put wheels on it to make it drivable. It could thereticaly defuse a bomb or other such things.
### What I need
ABS, Acrylic, Adafruit Metro M4, Camera, Four stepper motors, ~~Areotech G80, Areotech firstfire mini igniter~~, 12V lithium pack, at least one yoga ball (for testing) ~~N-channel mosfets~~.
### What I need to learn
I need to learn how to do object targeting/identification. ~~I want to learn how to make the robot say "bye bye" and launch itself into the sky in an emergency.~~ 
I have to learn how to make the robot arm able to pick up something sharp and stab holes in things. I don't know how to do this at the moment which makes it more fun. 
Other than that I don't have much to learn about it.
