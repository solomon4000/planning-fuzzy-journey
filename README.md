## planning

### criteria
The ideas that this is based on are that:
The robot arm must be able to pick up any chess piece and move it to another location on a chess board.
The robot arm must be able to autonomously recognize red objects, pick them up, and place them in a bin.
The robot arm must be able to write letters entered on a keypad.
The robot arm must be able to press keys on a piano to play a simple song.
The robot arm must have a rocket booster on it that lets it escape in an emergency.
The robot arm must be able to at least pick up a pencil stab a hole in a yoga ball for selfe defence (let's ignore the laws of robotics)
### How to acomplish
To acomplish this we can start with the rocket launcher cause its the coolest. I was going to have a rocket motor strapped to the bottom of it. This lets you 
target an object and fire.
As for detecting red objects and the chess peice I was going to use color sensors or something of the like. I was going to have the robot arm have 
3 hands/grabbers. 
### What I need
ABS, Acrylic, Adafruit Metro M4, Camera, Three stepper motors, Areotech G80, Areotech firstfire mini igniter, 12V lithium pack, at least one yoga ball (for testing).
### What I need to learn
I need to learn how to do object targeting/identification. I want to learn how to make the robot say "bye bye" and launch itself into the sky in an emergency. 
I have to learn how to make the robot arm able to pick up something sharp and stab holes in things. I don't know how to do this at the moment which makes it more fun. 
Other than that I don't have much to learn about it.
