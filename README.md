## planning

### criteria
The ideas that this is based on are that:
The robot arm must be able to pick up any chess piece and move it to another location on a chess board.
The robot arm must be able to autonomously recognize red objects, pick them up, and place them in a bin.
The robot arm must be able to write letters entered on a keypad.
The robot arm must be able to press keys on a piano to play a simple song.
The robot arm must have a rocket booster on it that lets it escape in an emergency.
The robot arm must be able to at least pick up a pencil stab a hole in a yoga ball for selfe defence (let's ignore the laws of robotics)
### How to acomplish
To acomplish this we can start with the rocket launcher cause its the coolest. I was going to have a model rocket launch rod attached to two servos. This lets you 
target an object and fire. The rocket should be made out of ductile lightweight materials incase AI trys to overthrow everybody.
As for detecting red objects and the chess peice I was going to use color sensors or something of the like. I was going to have the robot arm have 
3 hands/grabbers. 

### What I need to learn
I need to learn how to do object targeting/identification. I want to learn how to make the robot say "bye bye" and launch itself into the sky
