### criteria
Here is a good option
This is a robot that has a drill with a bit that is larger than the robot itself. This is a tunnel boring robot.
I want to do this to bore into mountains and cinderblocks. There isn't to much of a point to this.

Torque that is required should be about 3.25NMs
therefore at 3000RPM the motor required should be 1084.49349198W
